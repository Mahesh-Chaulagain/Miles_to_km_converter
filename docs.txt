Tkinter Layout Managers -> define how to position each of the widget

1. Pack -> packs each widget next to each other in a vaguely logical format
        -> by default always start from the top and pack every other widget just below the previous one
        -> Example: my_label.pack(side="left")
        -> problem: unable to specify precise position

2. Place -> is all about precise positioning
         -> can provide X and Y value
         -> Example: my_label.place(x=0, y=0)
         -> problem: it is so specific have to work on precise coordinates

3. Grid -> imagines that your entire program is a grid and you can divide it into any number of rows and columns
        -> Example: my_label.grid(column=0, row=0)
        -> is relative to other components

NOte* -> You can't mix up grid and pack in the same program
